# TechDegreeProject-2

Project #2 introduces additional fundamentals; primarily DOM selection and traversal using the JQuery library. It also introduces the concept of Progressive Enhancement by using JavaScript to enhance the user experience without requiring JavaScript for the web page to be functional.

### What does it do?

This project uses the pagination technique to reduce a long list of items into a manageable subset that is viewable on each page. In addition to the pagination, I have included a search box that can be used to search the list for each item's name or email. The results of each search are also paginated is the list exceeds the page display limit.
